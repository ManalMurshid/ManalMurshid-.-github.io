It seems like you're asking how to include database configuration details along with an SQL dump in a GitHub repository and document this in the README file. Here's a general outline of the steps you can follow:

1. **Create a README File:**
   Create a README file in your GitHub repository. This file will serve as documentation for your project. You can name it `README.md`.

2. **Write Documentation:**
   In your README file, provide clear instructions on how to set up and use your project, including the database configuration and how to use the included SQL dump.

3. **Include Database Configuration:**
   You can include a section in the README that explains the database configuration details. This might include the database name, host, port, username, and any other relevant information. However, it's important to note that sharing sensitive information like passwords or other credentials in a public repository is not recommended for security reasons. If you need to share this kind of information, consider using environment variables or configuration files that are not committed to the repository.

4. **Include SQL Dump:**
   You can provide the SQL dump in your repository. You can either create a file named `dump.sql` (or something similar) and include the SQL dump statements you want to share. You can also create a separate folder for SQL files if you have multiple dumps or related scripts.

5. **Git Ignore:**
   Make sure to include a `.gitignore` file in your repository to exclude sensitive files or folders, like configuration files containing credentials. This ensures that these files won't be pushed to the repository.

6. **Sample Section in README:**
   Here's an example of how you might structure the relevant section in your README file:

   ```markdown
   ## Database Configuration

   To set up the database for this project, follow these steps:

   1. Create a new database in your MariaDB server.
   2. Edit the database configuration in `config.php` (or use environment variables) to include the appropriate details.
   3. Import the SQL dump provided in the `sql` folder using the following command:

   ```bash
   mysql -u username -p database_name < sql/dump.sql
   ```

   Make sure to replace `username` with your database username and `database_name` with the target database name.

   Please note that you should not commit sensitive information like passwords to this repository. Instead, use environment variables or configuration files that are excluded from version control.
   ```

Remember to adapt the instructions to match your project's specifics and to provide clear and accurate guidance for anyone using your repository.
